# CS231_Reddit-Word-Frequency-Analyzer

A word frequency analyzer that uses BSTMaps and HashMaps to determine the frequencies of all the words in a given text document.

This project allowed me to analyze how word trends changed over time and taught me how to best work with extremely large sets of data (all Reddit posts and comments over a 8 year period)

**To see the code for this project, see the master branch**
